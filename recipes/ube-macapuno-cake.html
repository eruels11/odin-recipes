            <li>½ cup corn syrup</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>7 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 drops red food color</li>
            <li>6 drops blue food coloring</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) jar macapuno (coconut preserves)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Buttercream:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk, chilled</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 drop violet food coloring</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line the bottom of three 9-inch round pans with parchment paper, but do not grease.</li>
            <li>Make the ube cake: Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl; set aside. Place grated ube in a large bowl. Combine 3/4 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla; gradually blend into ube until smooth. Blend in egg yolks, corn syrup, and oil. Beat in flour mixture until smooth; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add sugar, then red and blue food coloring, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Invert pans on a wire rack and let cool upside down. When cool, run a knife around the edges to loosen cake from the pans. Spread coconut preserves onto the cooled cake layers; stack layers on a cake stand or serving plate.</li>
            <li>Make the buttercream: Combine evaporated milk and 3/4 cup sugar; set aside. Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in food coloring, one drop at a time, until the desired tint is achieved. Frost top and sides of cake with buttercream.</li>
